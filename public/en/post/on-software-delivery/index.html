Software delivery concept evolution (SWOT analysis)

  
      
          Concept
          strength
          weakness
          opportunity
          threat
      
  
  
      
          library
          extension and consolidation
          requires build; cannot deploy independently
          semantic versions
          dependency hell; backward / forward compatibility
      
      
          runtime binary &#43; scripts
          deploy independently; cross-platform;
          slow; cannot conceal information; need a large runtime to do small things
          fast development
          hard to maintain; cannot hide sensitive information
      
      
          binary packages / installers
          does not require build; has more complexity
          cannot cross-platform; cannot fully control the deployment environment
          sell as products, license and fee
          hard to upgrade; security risks.
      
      
          services on servers
          more control on the deployment sites; upgrade anytime
          performance / experience depends on network connections
          APIs; social networks; zero down time; freeminum
          network security; do not control client upgrades
      
      
          distributed / tiered services
          independent deployment and evolution, divide and conquer
          coupled with the human structure (Conway’s law)
          business can hire more people
          single point of failure; service explosion and governance; inconsistency
      
      
          virtualization
          higher efficiency on hardware resources
          start / stop is slow (in minutes)
          scale up and down; pay as you go
          more security loopholes
      
      
          containerization
          a new interface to deliver and run software fast and cheap
          docker / containerd  dependency; loss of observability and performance;
          docker image repos; CI / CD
          docker vendor turf wars
      
      
          container orchestration
          container operations
          still need to maintain nodes
          multi-tenancy container clusters; sidecars
          vendor lock-in on k8s designs and cloud providers; too many yamls; loss of dev agility
      
      
          service mesh
          observability, network routing, more ways of load balancing and flow control
          more network hops and latencies; over design for most systems;
          chaos engineering, system-level performance testing
          Sidecar errors may be a single point of failure
      
      
          Serverless
          divide between functional and non-functional requirements
          reinventing PaaS; maybe a wrong division; hard to work on special non-functional requirements.
          low-code, no-code: faster development with less qualified developer.
          too many hidden layers; vendor lock-in
      
      
          IDC
          outsourcing hardwares
          performance dependent on IDC connections and power supply
          multi-region availability; CDN; pay as you go on hardware layer.
          data security; cannot evolve on hardware  / software integrations
      
      
          Cloud
          outsourcing softwares and system operations
          system has more hidden layers
          easy infrastructure; pay as you go on more layers; no need to maintain hardwares
          vendor lock-in; Hotel California pricing

# performance reviews from manager

## 2024
review focus
inspire
innovative, industry-informed solutions
proactive problem-solving approach
commitment to seeking challenges in your daily work 
As the engineering owner of ES, introduced a score-based mechanism in a single release
AI-based robot ... expand your influence beyond  

Firstly, I want to acknowledge your growth in the tech lead role. You’ve increased your focus on reviews, from 20% to 30% of your work, and team members regularly seek your help and advice. This demonstrates the trust and reliability you’ve built. Feedback from the team also highlights your ability to inspire others and offer innovative, industry-informed solutions.

Your commitment to seeking challenges in your daily work is particularly impressive, especially as our team grows—leading both the CIEC team and collaborating with others is our next big opportunity. Your proactive problem-solving approach aligns well with team goals. As the engineering owner of ES, you introduced a score-based mechanism in a single release and continually refined ES. As we discussed, we’ll bring another member to support ES maintenance, allowing you to focus on other high-priority projects.

Your AI-based robot vision has also captured KM’s interest. Consistent contributions to engineering-driven projects like this expand your influence beyond Biz-UI. I know you have an interest in this topic, not care too much if it will be leveraged. I encourage you to continue making an impact in this space.

## 2023

more mature tech lead role
lead hackathon projects
quick learning capability
contributions to Compliance and Security
proactive approach to solving problems and addressing areas for improvement
As the ENG owner of ES and the MKPL approval process

Compared to 2022, your growth into a more mature tech lead role is evident. Your commitment to reviews and your willingness to lead hackathon projects showcase your dedication. You could spend more time on reviews to show your tech insights. Team feedback highlights your ability to inspire others, providing innovative and industry-informed solutions. Your contributions to Compliance and Security demonstrated your capacity to introduce fresh perspectives to the Biz-UI team, a trend I hope you'll continue in the coming year.

Your proactive approach to solving problems and addressing areas for improvement aligns seamlessly with the team's needs. Your focus on handling small improvements post-GA has been commendable, demonstrating your quick learning capability. Thank you for your contributions to MKPL business. As the ENG owner of ES and the MKPL approval process, you continuously spent some effort on maintaining some foundation modules, which also demonstrates your commitment.

Looking ahead to 2024, I hope you can lead the team in adopting new tech solutions, and contribute to ENG-driven projects, including AI-related initiatives that align with your strengths. Your ability to extend your tech influence beyond Biz-UI is a valuable asset, and I encourage you to continue spreading your impact including both technical and business. From the 2024 roadmap, I am confident you will play a critical role in the Demand-side product.

Marketplace Search Optimization
As the lead developer for Marketplace Search, I led efforts to optimize search performance and accuracy for Marketplace pages and APIs, by projects like supporting quick search for Marketplace items in the MRM Home page, building search related metrics and dashboard, consolidating data synchronization workflows, monitoring and fixing data differences, and upgrading ES clusters for enhanced stability. These endeavours lead to a more intuitive user experience and increased customer satisfaction.

MPP Order/Listing Revision Enhancements
I spearheaded multiple initiatives and worked with PM to design and implement a bi-party configuration framework for revision features and integrating more fields into the current framework. Also cleared up some related legacy codes used by deprecated Campaign Manager.
These efforts led to better sales management for marketplace selling and buying clients, and improved code maintainability driving more efficient operations.

Marketplace Services Reorganization
As a lead developer for Marketplace team and with the help of other team leads, I investigated the general approach, laid foundation works and reviewed large amounts of codes for merging Listing Service into Marketplace Order Service, which aligned the system architecture to reflect our engineer team's changes, improved the code maintainability and quality, and helped to better grow our team into a global one with multiple timezones and cultures.

Vision Chatbot
As the owner and key developer of the "Vision" AI chatbot project, I fetched data from MRM User Guide, selected FreeWheel wiki pages, API documentations and hackathon projects, and feeded to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses, improving resource accessibility and operational efficiency.

RCA (Root Cause Analysis) for Critical Issues
Conducted and presented comprehensive RCAs for issues like unexpected passback reset (ESC-67357) and invalid targeting criteria types (ESC-66469).
These RCAs led to robust fixes that prevented their recurrence, thus ensuring system stability and reliability.

## 2022
technical expert role
enlighten others, give them out of box solution or industry insights
focus on Buyer side product this year including CM API, Approval workflow, political campaign integration, etc


Fan plays technical expert role in Biz-UI team, he is willing to share his tech insights to concrete issues/questions. I received serveral feedback from team members that Fan always enlighten others, give them out of box solution or industry insights. Bring new solutions to Biz-UI team instead of just following.

Fan was focus on Buyer side product this year including CM API, Approval workflow, political campaign integration, etc. He is willing to simplify the work by tools. And he also willing to contribute to existing projects instead of repeating the wheels. He joined Blinc, Slack assistant for T3, protoc-gen-doc, etc. ENG driven internal projects/tools, and contributed his energy to improve ENG productivity.

I saw Fan's grow this year on lead role, he is willing to share his time and energy to help others, which needs keeping doing. And spread his tech influence out of biz-ui is the new goal for him.

## 2021
DBA collaboration: a good achievement/justification that we inline promote you to Lead Software Engineer

DBA collaboration(from June 2020 to June 2021): we have clear metrics to demonstrate the project value. With your help, DBA team has tools and practice, which reduce the DBA manual work, increase team productivity. That is a good achievement/justification that we inline promote you to Lead Software Engineer in May.

- Tech influence(keep doing):
- Proactively contribute your insight/comment in BSAP/CNTOC
- Submit one Comcast patent idea
- Participate in writing a book
- Introduce automation to reduce manual efforts(dual write checker).
- Solve tech challenges during projects(Bingo-MOD)

Business accumulation: proactively attend some feature discussions. As the next step, I believe you have opportunity to drive some feature discussion, especially for cross-team discussion. Leverage your knowledge to solve production issues.

(Start to do)You are the tech lead now, lead team members on business/technical, is your new responsibility. I know you have started to do something, but we still need to track the progress and the true values to the team.

Notes: Communicated with Fan about difference between my evaluation and his self-evaluation.

So, the headlines say somebody else has died due to video game addiction. Yes, it's Korea again. 报纸上又有玩电子游戏致死的消息。没错，又是韩国。

What the hell? Look, I'm not saying video games are heroin. I totally get that the victims had other shit going on in their lives. But, half of you reading this know a World of Warcraft addict and experts say video game addiction is a thing. So here's the big question: Are some games intentionally designed to keep you compulsively playing, even when you're not enjoying it?

Oh, hell yes. And their methods are downright creepy.

搞毛啊？我可没说电子游戏是海洛因。我完全理解这些渣们的生活有其他各种杯具。但是读者你们很可能见过WoW瘾君子，而且专家也说了电子毒品绝非夸大其词。于是问题是：游戏是故意被设计成这样，让你像得了强迫症一样地去玩它，欲罢不能么？必须的！而且采取的手段真的很可怕。

## #5. Putting You in a Skinner Box
## No. 5 把你放在“斯金纳之箱”里

![](/images/vgames/2.png)

If you've ever been addicted to a game or known someone who was, this article is really freaking disturbing. It's written by a games researcher at Microsoft on how to make video games that hook players, whether they like it or not. He has a doctorate in behavioral and brain sciences. Quote:

如果你自己曾对某个游戏痴迷，或者认识这样的人，下面这段会让你很不舒服。作者是微软的一个游戏研究人员，行为学和脑科学博士，讲的是如何把玩家钩在游戏上，欲罢不能。引文如下：

> "Each contingency is an arrangement of time, activity, and reward, and there are an infinite number of ways these elements can be combined to produce the pattern of activity you want from your players."

> “每个游戏场景都是时间、行动与奖励的有机体，你可以随意操控它们之间的排列组合，让玩家按预先设定的模式来行动。”

Notice his article does not contain the words "fun" or "enjoyment." That's not his field. Instead it's "the pattern of activity you want."

请注意，他的文章根本没提到“好玩”或者“愉悦”，这不是他的研究领域。他关注的是“让玩家按预先设定的模式来行动。”

> "...at this point, younger gamers will raise their arms above their head, leaving them vulnerable."

> “…在这时，低龄玩家会双手举过头顶，精神十分脆弱。”

![](/images/vgames/3.png)

His theories are based around the work of BF Skinner, who discovered you could control behavior by training subjects with simple stimulus and reward. He invented the "Skinner Box," a cage containing a small animal that, for instance, presses a lever to get food pellets. Now, I'm not saying this guy at Microsoft sees gamers as a bunch of rats in a Skinner box. I'm just saying that he illustrates his theory of game design using pictures of rats in a Skinner box.

他的理论基于B. F. 斯金纳的工作，即可以通过刺激和奖励可以控制和训练被试者的行为。斯金纳发明了“斯金纳之箱”，一个带有一些装置的箱子，里边的小动物按一个拉杆可以得到一些食物颗粒。我不是说微软这货把玩家看成斯金纳箱里的小白鼠。我的意思是他使用斯金纳箱中的老鼠来阐述他的游戏设计理论。

This sort of thing caused games researcher Nick Yee to once call Everquest a "Virtual Skinner Box."

Nick Yee，一个游戏研究者，曾把“Everquest”（无尽的任务，一个网游）称作“虚拟斯金纳之箱”。

### So What's The Problem?

### 问题出在哪呢？

Gaming has changed. It used to be that once they sold us a $50 game, they didn't particularly care how long we played. The big thing was making sure we liked it enough to buy the next one. But the industry is moving toward subscription-based games like MMO's that need the subject to keep playing--and paying--until the sun goes supernova.

游戏产业今非昔比。以前他们只是把游戏用50美刀卖给我们，才不管我们会玩多长时间，只要我们能买他们的下一个游戏就好了。但是这个产业的盈利模式正在转向为基于订阅的，如网游，需要玩家持续地在线，一直玩，一直付钱----直到太阳爆炸为超新星。

![](/images/vgames/5.png)

Now, there's no way they can create enough exploration or story to keep you playing for thousands of hours, so they had to change the mechanics of the game, so players would instead keep doing the same actions over and over and over, whether they liked it or not. So game developers turned to Skinner's techniques.

当然做出再多的地图或者故事，也不可能让你玩上千个小时不重样。所以他们必须改变游戏的机制，让玩家重复地做同样的事，一遍又一遍，欲罢不能。斯金纳之箱就是他们的方法。

This is a big source of controversy in the world of game design right now. Braid creator Jonathan Blow said Skinnerian game mechanics are a form of "exploitation." It's not that these games can't be fun. But they're designed to keep gamers subscribing during the periods when it's not fun, locking them into a repetitive slog using Skinner's manipulative system of carefully scheduled rewards.

目前游戏设计界对此有颇多争执。Jonathan Blow说，斯金纳式的游戏机制是一种“探索”的过程，“不是说这些游戏不好玩，而是设计上要考虑如何让玩家觉得厌倦时还能继续玩下去，用斯金纳式的奖惩操控系统，把他们锁在重复性的劳动岗上。”

Why would this work, when the "rewards" are just digital objects that don't actually exist? Well...

为啥这招这么有效，即使所谓的“奖励”只是些子虚乌有的数字对象？请继续往下看。

## #4. Creating Virtual Food Pellets For You To Eat

## No. 4 做出虚拟的食物颗粒给你吃

![](/images/vgames/6.png)

Most addiction-based game elements are based on this fact:

大多数让人上瘾的游戏元素得益于以下事实：

Your brain treats items and goods in the video game world as if they are real. Because they are.

你的大脑不会区别对待电子游戏中的事物，就好像它们是真的一样。因为它们确实是真的。

People scoff at this idea all the time ("You spent all that time working for a sword that doesn't even exist?") and those people are stupid. If it takes time, effort and skill to obtain an item, that item has value, whether it's made of diamonds, binary code or beef jerky.

人们总对此嗤之以鼻(“你花了那么多时间就为拿到一把压根不存在的破剑？”)，但这种蔑视是愚蠢的。只能通过花费时间、精力和技巧才能得到的东西，必定是有价值的，无论是它是钻石做的，还是二进制码或者牛肉筋。

![](/images/vgames/7.png)

That's why the highest court in South Korea ruled that virtual goods are to be legally treated the same as real goods. And virtual goods are now a $5 billion industry worldwide.

韩国的最高法院已经判定，虚拟商品法律上与真实商品等效。这些虚拟商品的背后，是一个在世界范围内有50亿美刀的产业。

There's nothing crazy about it. After all, people pay thousands of dollars for diamonds, even though diamonds do nothing but look pretty. A video game suit of armor looks pretty and protects you from video game orcs. In both cases you're paying for an idea.

这一点也不疯狂。人们花上千美刀买颗钻石，钻石除了好看也没啥用。电子游戏的装备看上去也很拉风，还能保护你不被兽人侵害。二者是一样的，你在为一个想法付钱。

![](/images/vgames/8.png)

**Happy anniversary, honey.**

**结婚纪念日快乐，亲爱的。（意思是不买钻石，买电子游戏装备）**

### So What's The Problem?

### 有什么问题吗？

Of course, virtually every game of the last 25 years has included items you can collect in the course of defeating the game--there's nothing new or evil about that. But because gamers regard in-game items as real and valuable on their own, addiction-based games send you running around endlessly collecting them even if they have nothing to do with the game's objective.

近25年来的几乎每个游戏都有可收集的物品，这不是什么新鲜玩意，也没啥不好。但因为玩家把游戏物品看做是真实且本身具有价值的，游戏设计者就会故意让玩家去到处收集物品，这种活动和游戏通关的目标毫无关系。

It is very much intentional on the developers' part, an appeal to our natural hoarding and gathering instincts, collecting for the sake of collecting. It works, too, just ask the guy who kept collecting items even while naked boobies sat just feet away. Boobies.

设计者绝对是故意的，迎合人们收集的自然本能，让玩家是为了收集而收集。这真的有效，不信你看那个身边有软妹子还在玩游戏收集隐藏物品的家伙。收你妹啊。


As the article from the Microsoft guy proves, developers know they're using these objects as pellets in a Skinner box. At that point it's all about...

正如微软那货的文章指出的那样，游戏开发者有意在利用斯金纳箱中的那些食物小颗粒来引诱玩家，接下来就是…

## #3. Making You Press the Lever

## No. 3 让你自己去按下拉杆

So picture the rat in his box. Or, since I'm one of these gamers and don't like to think of myself as a rat, picture an adorable hamster. Maybe he can talk, and is voiced by Chris Rock.

想象一下箱子里的小白鼠。或者如果你不喜欢把自己想成一只老鼠，想成一只可爱的小仓鼠也可以。小仓鼠可以说话，由Chris Rock配音。

![](/images/vgames/9.png)

If you want to make him press the lever as fast as possible, how would you do it? Not by giving him a pellet with every press--he'll soon relax, knowing the pellets are there when he needs them. No, the best way is to set up the machine so that it drops the pellets at random intervals of lever pressing. He'll soon start pumping that thing as fast as he can. Experiments prove it.

如果你想让它尽可能快地按下拉杆，怎么做？不要每次它按下时给它食物---它很快就会懈怠，知道如果它想要，肯定能得到食物。最好的办法是在它按下拉杆时，以一定几率落下食物。它很快就会发了疯一样的按那个拉杆。实验中就是如此。

![](/images/vgames/10.png)


They call these "Variable Ratio Rewards" in Skinner land and this is the reason many enemies "drop" valuable items totally at random in WoW. This is addictive in exactly the same way a slot machine is addictive. You can't quit now because the very next one could be a winner. Or the next. Or the next.

在“斯金纳的王国”他们把这叫做“浮动比率奖励”。这就是为什么WoW中许多敌人会随机“掉落”贵重物品的原因。这和老虎机让人上瘾的原因是一样的。你可不能现在走，走了下一个人就全赢了。或者下一个。下下个。

![](/images/vgames/11.png)


The Chinese MMO ZT Online has the most devious implementation of this I've ever seen. The game is full of these treasure chests that may or may not contain a random item and to open them, you need a key. How do you get the keys? Why, you buy them with real-world money, of course. Like coins in a slot machine.

中国网游“征途”将这种手段用到了极致。游戏中充满了各种宝箱，里面可能有一个随机的物品，要打开箱子，你需要钥匙。如何得到钥匙？用钱买，现实中的钞票。这简直就是老虎机嘛。

Wait, that's not the best part. ZT Online does something even the casinos never dreamed up: They award a special item at the end of the day to the player who opens the most chests.

这还不算。“征途”的手段连赌场都甘拜下风：每天开箱子最多的玩家都会得到一个特别的大奖。

![](/images/vgames/12.png)

Now, in addition to the gambling element, you have thousands of players in competition with each other, to see who can be the most obsessive about opening the chests. One woman tells of how she spent her entire evening opening chests--over a thousand--to try to win the daily prize.

除了利用到人的赌博天性，成千上万的玩家都在彼此竞争，看谁能开最多的箱子。一个女人告诉我，她曾整个晚上都在开箱子----超过一千个----试图赢取每日大奖。

She didn't. There was always someone else more obsessed.

她没赢。总有人更沉迷。

### So What's The Problem?

### 有什么问题吗？

Are you picturing her sitting there, watching her little character in front of the chest, clicking dialogue boxes over and over, watching the same animation over and over, for hour after hour?

你能想象她坐在那，看着她的小人在箱子旁边，一遍又一遍地点对话框，一遍又一遍地看同样的动画效果，就这样消耗掉一小时又一小时？

![](/images/vgames/13.gif)

If you didn't know any better, you'd think she had a crippling mental illness. How could she possibly get from her rational self to that Rain Man-esque compulsion?

如果你不了解，你会觉得她有严重的心理疾病。一个有理性的人怎么可能表现出这种“雨人”一样的强迫症行为？

BF Skinner knew. He called that training process "shaping." Little rewards, step by step, like links in a chain. In WoW you decide you want the super cool Tier 10 armor. You need five separate pieces. To get the full set, you need more than 400 Frost Emblems, which are earned a couple at a time, from certain enemies. Then you need to upgrade each piece of armor with Marks of Sanctification. Then again with Heroic Marks of Sanctification. To get all that you must re-run repetitive missions and sit, clicking your mouse, for days and days and days. Boobies be damned.

B. F. Skinner了解。他称这种训练过程为“塑形”。小小的奖励，步步引诱，就像链条上的环节。在WoW中你想要拿到拉风的T10套装。你需要5个部件。集齐套装需要400个冰霜灰烬，这种物品从某些敌人身上一次掉两三个。然后需要把每个装备部件用神圣印记升级。然后再用英雄的神圣印记升级。要得到这些你需要重复完成同样的任务，一天又一天地坐在那里点鼠标，玩游戏。软妹子怨念中。

![](/images/vgames/14.png)

Once it gets to that point, can you even call that activity a "game" anymore? It's more like scratching a rash. And it gets worse...

到这种程度，你觉得还能把这种活动叫“游戏”？更像是出疹子时忍不住去挠。这还不是最可怕的…

## #2.Keeping You Pressing It... Forever

## No. 2 让你不断去按…直到永远

![](/images/vgames/15.png)


Now, the big difference between our Skinner box hamster and a real human is that we humans can get our pellets elsewhere. If a game really was just nothing but clicking a box for random rewards, we'd eventually drop it to play some other game. Humans need a long-term goal to keep us going, and the world of addictive gaming has got this down to a science. Techniques include...

斯金纳箱中的小仓鼠和真实世界的人有一个重大区别：我们从别处也能得到奖赏。如果一个游戏的全部内容就是点击对话框随机出一些奖品，我们最终会厌倦，去玩别的游戏。需要有一个长线的目标让我们继续游戏。而游戏设计者对此得心应手，几乎发展成了一门科学。这些手段包括：

* Easing Them In:

* 容易上手

First, set up the "pellets" so that they come fast at first, and then slower and slower as time goes on. This is why they make it very easy to earn rewards (or level up) in the beginning of an MMO, but then the time and effort between levels increases exponentially. Once the gamer has experienced the rush of leveling up early, the delayed gratification actually increases the pleasure of the later levels. That video game behavior expert at Microsoft found that gamers play more and more frantically as they approach a new level.

一上来先让“食物”掉的很快，然后逐渐减缓奖赏的频度。这也是为什么网游一上来得到奖赏很容易（升级很快），但是之后升级所花时间和精力成指数增长。玩家在开始游戏时会体验到快速升级的爽快，而之后不断推迟的奖励实际上反而增强了每次升级的快感。微软的那个电子游戏专家指出，玩家在角色将要升级之前的那段时间会更加疯狂地游戏。

* Eliminating Stopping Points:

* 去掉终点线

The easiest way is to just put save points far apart, or engage the player in long missions (like WoW raids) that, once started, are difficult to get out of without losing progress.

But that can be frustrating for gamers, so you can take the opposite approach of a game like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, where you make the levels really short so it's like eating potato chips. They're so small on their own that it doesn't take much convincing to get the player to grab another one, and soon they've eaten the whole bag.

最容易的方法是把存盘点间的距离设得很远，或者（像WoW副本那样）让玩家进行超长的任务，一旦开始就不能中途退出，否则前功尽弃。但这有时会让玩家很抓狂，所以你也可以反其道而行之，像Wii版的新超级玛丽兄弟那样，把每一关设计得很短，玩起来就像吃薯片。单个薯片看起来很小，很容易就能诱惑玩家再抓一片，再抓一片…很快一包就这么没了。

![](/images/vgames/16.png)


By the way, this is the same reason a person who wouldn't normally read a 3,000-word article on the Internet will happily read it if it's split up into list form. Are you ignoring boobies to read this? I've done my job!

顺便说一句，平时很少有人在网上会读超过3000字的文章。所以我把这篇文章分成了很多小的条目。如果你因为读它而忽视了身边的软妹子，那么我成功了。

* Play It Or Lose It:

* 不玩你就输了:

This is the real dick move. Why reward the hamster for pressing the lever? Why not simply set it up so that when he fails to press it, we punish him?

这实在是很损的一招。为什么要奖励小仓鼠按下拉杆？为什么不在它没按的时候，给它点惩罚？

Behaviorists call this "avoidance." They set the cage up so that it gives the animal an electric shock every 30 seconds unless it hits the lever. It learns very very fast to stay on the lever, all the time, hitting it over and over. Forever.

行为学家称之为“规避”。他们每隔三十秒电击一次小动物，除非它按下拉杆。它很快就学会趴在拉杆上，一遍又一遍地去按它。直到永远。

![](/images/vgames/17.png)

Why is your mom obsessively harvesting her crops in Farmville? Because they wither and rot if she doesn't. In Ultima Online, your house or castle would start to decay if you didn't return to it regularly. In Animal Crossing, the town grows over with weeds and your virtual house becomes infested with cockroaches if you don't log in often enough. It's the crown jewel of game programming douchebaggery--keep the player clicking and clicking and clicking just to avoid losing the stuff they worked so hard to get.

为什么你妈妈这么喜欢玩Farmville（人人农场原型），每天收菜？因为如果不收，庄稼作物会枯萎烂掉。在“Ultima Online”，你的宅子或城堡会渐渐腐坏，除非你经常访问他们。在“Animal Crossing”，如果你不经常登录，你的城镇会被野草覆盖，房子会被小强占领。这简直就是游戏混蛋逻辑王冠上的明珠----让玩家不断点击，如果不想失去辛苦劳动换来的胜利果实的话。

* All Of the Above:

* 综上所述：

Each of those techniques has a downside and to get the ultimate addictive game, you combine as many as possible, along with the "random drop" gambling element mentioned before (count how many of these techniques are in WoW). They get the hamster running back and forth from one lever to another to another.

以上所说的每种手段都有不足，要做出让人超级上瘾的游戏，你需要把它们组合起来运用，连同前边介绍的“随机掉落”这种赌博元素（数数WoW被点名了几次）。这些手段，让小仓鼠们上蹿下跳，从一个拉杆到另一个拉杆，再到另一个。

![](/images/vgames/18.png)


### So What's The Problem?

### 问题出在哪呢？

We asked earlier if the item collection via obsessive clicking could be called a "game." So that raises the question: What is a game?

前边我们提出了一个问题，通过强迫症一样的点击鼠标来收集物品算不算在“游戏”？更确切的问题是，什么是游戏？

Well, we humans play games because there is a basic satisfaction in mastering a skill, even if it's a pointless one in terms of our overall life goals. It helps us develop our brains (especially as children) and to test ourselves without serious consequences if we fail. This is why our brains reward us with the sensation we call "fun" when we do it. Hell, even dolphins do it:

我们人玩游戏是因为掌握一种技巧的过程能带来很大的满足感，即使这种技巧没什么意义，与我们的人生目标毫无联系。游戏能开发大脑（特别是对小孩子），还能测验人的能力，即使失败了也不会没什么严重的后果。这也是为什么大脑在我们游戏时会产生一种感觉以资鼓励，我们称之为“好玩”。

This is why I haven't included games like Guitar Hero in this article. They're addictive, sure, but in a way everybody understands. It's perfectly natural to enjoy getting good at something.

Likewise, competitive games like Modern Warfare 2 are just sports for people who lack athleticism. There's no mystery there; everybody likes to win.

这也是为什么我不把“吉他英雄”这样的游戏包括在讨论范围的原因。它们是会上瘾没错，但每个人都明白为什么。享受从入门到精通的过程再自然不过了。同样的，竞技性的游戏，如现代战争2，是缺乏强健体魄的人们的运动。没什么神秘的：每个人都喜欢赢。

![](/images/vgames/19.png)

But these "hit the lever until you pass out from starvation" gaming elements stray into a different area completely. As others have pointed out, the point is to keep you playing long after you've mastered the skills, long after you've wrung the last real novel experience from it. You can't come up with a definition of "fun" that encompasses the activity of clicking a picture of a treasure chest with your mouse a thousand times.

但是那些“猛击拉杆直到饿昏过去”的游戏元素完全是另一码事。就像其他人指出的，这些游戏是要你在已经完全掌握了一门技巧之后很久，在你完全榨干它的最后一丝新鲜感之后很久，还得继续玩下去。你再怎么努力，也没法找到一种“好玩”的定义，能把用鼠标点击宝箱图片一千次这种活动包含在内。

This is why some writers blasted Blizzard when WoW introduced a new "achievement" system a couple of years ago. These are rewards tied to performing random pointless tasks, over and over again (such as, fishing until you catch a thousand fish). No new content, no element of practice, or discovery, or mastery was included. Just a virtual treadmill.

这也是为什么几年前WoW推出“成就”系统时暴雪饱受诟病的原因。成就是对达成一些随机、无意义、重复的目标的奖励（比如钓到1000条鱼）。没有新的内容，没有包含操作、探索，或者掌握的元素。就是一个虚拟的跑步机。

![](/images/vgames/20.png)


Of course, game developers (and various commenters, I'm sure) would correctly point out that nobody is making the players do it. Why would humans voluntarily put themselves in laboratory hamster mode? Well, it's all about...

当然，游戏开发者（我确定还有好多评论家）都会好心指出，没人强迫玩家必须要做什么。为什么人会自愿地把自己置于实验小仓鼠的悲惨境地呢？当然会，因为他们…

## #1.Getting You To Call the Skinner Box Home

## No. 让你在斯金纳之箱中找到家的感觉

![](/images/vgames/21.png)


Do you like your job?

你喜欢你的工作吗？

Considering half of you are reading this at work, I'm going to guess no. And that brings us to the one thing that makes gaming addiction--and addiction in general--so incredibly hard to beat.

考虑到你们中一半的人在工作时读这篇东西，我猜答案是不喜欢。这就不得不提到让游戏成瘾----或者通常意义上的成瘾----如此难以戒除的根源。

As shocking as this sounds, a whole lot of the "guy who failed all of his classes because he was playing WoW all the time" horror stories are really just about a dude who simply didn't like his classes very much. This was never some dystopian mind control scheme by Blizzard. The games just filled a void.

尽管听起来挺难以置信，但恐怖故事里“因为老玩魔兽挂掉了所有科目的卢瑟”也许只是一个不喜欢上课的倒霉孩子。暴雪公司可不是什么精神控制阴谋论的幕后黑手。游戏只是填补了一个空缺。

Why do so many of us have that void? Because according to everything expert Malcolm Gladwell, to be satisfied with your job you need three things, and I bet most of you don't even have two of them:

为什么我们会有那个空缺？因为据全知全能先生Malcolm Gladwell所说，要想对自己的工作满意必须要有三样东西，我打赌你们大多连两样也没有：

* Autonomy (that is, you have some say in what you do day to day);

* 自治（就是说，你每天做什么在某种程度上是自己说了算的）

* Complexity (so it's not mind-numbing repetition);

* 复杂性（所以不是简单的无脑重复）；

* Connection Between Effort and Reward (i.e. you actually see the awesome results of your hard work).

* 付出和回报之间的关联（就是说你努力工作就真的能见到了不起的成果）。

![](/images/vgames/22.png)

**Notice that pants are not necessary for job satisfaction.**

**有没有穿裤子是不会影响工作满意度的**

Most people, particularly in the young gamer demographics, don't have this in their jobs or in any aspect of their everyday lives. But the most addictive video games are specifically geared to give us all three... or at least the illusion of all three.

大多数人，尤其是年轻的游戏人群，都缺乏这三样东西，工作中如此，生活中的其他方面亦如此。但是那些最让人上瘾的游戏能给予我们所有这三样东西…至少是它们的幻觉。    

* Autonomy:

* 自治：

You pick your quests, or which Farmville crops to plant. Hell, you even pick your own body, species and talents.

你选择做哪些任务，或者在农场种哪些庄稼。你甚至能选择自己的身体、种族和天赋。

![](/images/vgames/23.png)

**Annoying your Facebook friends with updates is a really annoying talent.**

**用烦人的消息更新来烦你的Facebook好友真是一项烦人的才能**

* Complexity:

* 复杂性：

Players will do monotonous grinding specifically because it doesn't feel like grinding. Remember the complicated Tier Armor/Frost Emblem dance that kept our gamer clicking earlier.

玩家做重复性的无脑工作是因为它做起来不会让你感觉特别无脑。

记得前边提到的T10套装/冰霜灰烬的复杂舞步。

* Connection Between Effort and Reward:

* 付出和回报之间的关联

This is the big one. When you level up in WoW a goddamned plume of golden light shoots out of your body.

这很关键。你在WoW中升级时身体会迸射出耀眼的光柱。

![](/images/vgames/24.png)

This is what most of us don't get in everyday life--quick, tangible rewards. It's less about instant gratification and more about a freaking sense of accomplishment. How much harder would we work at the office if we got this, and could measure our progress toward it? And if the light shot from our crotch?

这可不是我们每天能得到的---迅捷的、强烈可感的奖励。与其说是立即得到好处的作用，不如说是一种达成目标的强烈快感。如果我们每天在办公室能得到这种奖励，并且可以量化达成既定目标的进程，那工作得多玩命？要是你体内能迸发出光柱呢？

The beauty of it is it lets games use the tedium to their advantage. As we discussed elsewhere, there's a "work to earn the right to play" aspect of World of Warcraft, where you grind or "farm" for gold for the right to do the cool stuff later. The tedious nature of the farming actually adds to the sense of accomplishment later. And it also helps squash any sense of guilt you might have had about neglecting school, work or household chores to play the game. After all, you did your chores--the 12 hours you spent farming for gold last Tuesday was less fun than mowing the fucking lawn. Now it's time for fun.

妙就妙在可以将无聊的过程利用起来。正如我们刚才讨论的，WoW有一种“工作赚取玩的权利”的魔力，你需要煎熬着升级或者“刷副本”赚钱，这样才能够在之后玩更酷的东西。“刷副本”的无聊反而加强了之后成就带来的喜悦感，而且顺便帮你摆脱了逃学、怠工或者不做家务去玩游戏的负罪感。毕竟，你做了很多讨厌的工作----上周二花了12小时刷副本赚钱，简直比修剪草坪还特么累。终于可以玩一会儿了。

### So What's The Problem?

### 问题出在哪呢？

Video game designer Erin Hoffman said it perfectly: "Addiction is not about what you DO, but what you DON'T DO because of the replacement of the addictive behavior." She was talking about how the attraction of a simple flash game like Bejeweled depends entirely on how badly you want to avoid doing the work you have open in the other window.

电子游戏设计者Erin Hoffman说的很好：“成瘾行为的危害并不在于你做了某件事，而在于由于总是做那件事而没有做你该做的事”。她是在说，宝石迷阵这样简单的flash游戏对你的吸引力，取决于你有多不想做另一个窗口中打开的工作。

![](/images/vgames/25.png)

**Wait, what was I saying again?**

**额，我刚才说到哪了？**

The terrible truth is that a whole lot of us begged for a Skinner Box we could crawl into, because the real world's system of rewards is so much more slow and cruel than we expected it to be. In that, gaming is no different from other forms of mental escape, from sports fandom to moonshine.

可怕的事实是，我们中的许多人都在乞求有一个可以爬进去的斯金纳之箱，因为现实世界的奖励系统是如此缓慢而残酷，令人失望。在这个意义上，玩游戏和其他形式的精神逃避是一样的，如体育明星粉丝团，或者烈酒。

![](/images/vgames/26.png)

**Heroin: It's pretty much WoW in a syringe.**

**海洛因：不就是注射器里的WoW么。**

The danger lies in the fact that these games have become so incredibly efficient at delivering the sense of accomplishment that people used to get from their education or career. We're not saying gaming will ruin the world, or that gaming addiction will be a scourge on youth the way crack ruined the inner cities in the 90s. But we may wind up with a generation of dudes working at Starbucks when they had the brains and talent for so much more. They're dissatisfied with their lives because they wasted their 20s playing video games, and will escape their dissatisfaction by playing more video games. Rinse, repeat.

危险之处在于这些游戏在给予人们成就感方面太有成效了，曾经人们要获得这样高的成就感，只能通过长期的教育或职业生涯。我不是危言耸听，说游戏毁灭世界，或者游戏将是年轻一代的浩劫，如90年代毒品毁了城市街区那样。但是年轻一代中可能会有大批人因为沉迷游戏，到头来沦落在星巴克打工，而他们本来才华横溢，大有可为。他们把本该努力工作的双十年华献给了电子游戏，然后为了从令人失望的生活中逃避，玩更多的游戏，形成一个恶性循环。

And let's face it; if you think WoW is addictive, wait until you see the games they're making 10 years from now. They're only getting better at what they do.

面对现实吧：如果你觉得WoW让人上瘾，想想十年以后他们会做出什么样的游戏吧。他们只会越做越好。
